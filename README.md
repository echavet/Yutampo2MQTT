Features
	â€¢	Seamless Integration: Control and monitor your Yutampo water heater directly from Home Assistant.
	â€¢	MQTT Discovery: Automatically discovers devices and creates climate entities in Home Assistant.
	â€¢	Temperature Control: Adjust the setpoint temperature remotely.
	â€¢	Mode Control: Toggle between heat and off modes using Home Assistant.
	â€¢	Real-time Updates: Periodically fetches device states (temperature, mode, operation status) and updates Home Assistant.
	â€¢	Bidirectional Sync: Changes made via the CSNet Manager app are reflected in Home Assistant, and vice versa.
	â€¢	Detailed Status: Reports hvac_action (e.g., idle, heating, off) and custom operation labels for advanced monitoring.
Prerequisites
	â€¢	A running instance of Home Assistant with the MQTT integration configured (e.g., Mosquitto broker).
	â€¢	A Yutampo water heater connected to the CSNet Manager platform.
	â€¢	Valid credentials (username and password) for the CSNet Manager website.
	â€¢	Docker (if installing manually outside of Home Assistant add-ons).
Installation
Add-on Installation (Recommended)
	1	Add the Repository:
	â—¦	In Home Assistant, go to Settings > Add-ons > Add-on Store.
	â—¦	Click the three dots (...) in the top-right corner and select Repositories.
	â—¦	Add this repository URL: https://github.com/echavet/yutampo_ha_addon (replace USERNAME with your GitHub username).
	â—¦	Click Add and wait for the repository to load.
	2	Install the Add-on:
	â—¦	Find Yutampo HA Addon in the list of add-ons.
	â—¦	Click Install and wait for the process to complete.
	3	Configure the Add-on:
	â—¦	Go to the Configuration tab of the add-on.
	â—¦	Set your CSNet Manager credentials (username and password) and other options (see Configuration).
	â—¦	Save the configuration.
	4	Start the Add-on:
	â—¦	Go to the Info tab and click Start.
	â—¦	Check the Log tab to ensure the add-on starts without errors.
Manual Installation (Advanced)
For users who prefer running the add-on outside of Home Assistantâ€™s add-on system:
	1	Clone the Repository:â€¨git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/yutampo_ha_addon.git
	2	cd yutampo_ha_addon
	3	
	4	Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed, then install the required packages:â€¨pip install -r requirements.txt
	5	
	6	Set Environment Variables: Set the MQTT environment variables (as expected by the run.sh script):â€¨export MQTTHOST="your-mqtt-broker-host"
	7	export MQTTPORT="1883"
	8	export MQTTUSER="your-mqtt-username"
	9	export MQTTPASSWORD="your-mqtt-password"
	10	
	11	Configure Options: Create a /data/options.json file with your CSNet Manager credentials:â€¨{
	12	  "username": "your_csnetmanager_username",
	13	  "password": "your_csnetmanager_password",
	14	  "scan_interval": 30
	15	}
	16	
	17	Run the Add-on: Execute the main script:â€¨python3 main.py
	18	
Configuration
The add-on requires a configuration file (/data/options.json) with the following options:
Option
Description
Default
Required
username
Your CSNet Manager username
-
Yes
password
Your CSNet Manager password
-
Yes
scan_interval
Interval (in seconds) to fetch device updates
300
No
Example Configuration
{
  "username": "your_csnetmanager_username",
  "password": "your_csnetmanager_password",
  "scan_interval": 30
}
Environment Variables (for Manual Installation)
The MQTT broker settings are sourced from environment variables (set by run.sh in Home Assistant):
Variable
Description
Default
Required
MQTTHOST
MQTT broker host
-
Yes
MQTTPORT
MQTT broker port
1883
No
MQTTUSER
MQTT broker username
-
Yes
MQTTPASSWORD
MQTT broker password
-
Yes
Usage
	1	Start the Add-on:
	â—¦	If installed as a Home Assistant add-on, start it from the Info tab.
	â—¦	If running manually, execute python3 main.py as described above.
	2	Monitor Logs:
	â—¦	Check the logs in the Home Assistant Add-on interface or in your terminal.
	â—¦	Look for messages indicating successful authentication, MQTT connection, and device discovery.
	3	Home Assistant Integration:
	â—¦	Once running, the add-on will publish MQTT Discovery messages, creating climate entities in Home Assistant (e.g., climate.4103).
	â—¦	You can control the water heater (mode and temperature) directly from the Home Assistant UI.
	â—¦	Changes made via the CSNet Manager app will also be reflected in Home Assistant after the next update (based on scan_interval).
	4	Logbook:
	â—¦	Changes to mode (off â†’ heat) and action (idle, heating) are logged in the Home Assistant Logbook.
	â—¦	Temperature changes are published as attributes and can be viewed in the entity details, but may require additional customization to appear directly in the Logbook (e.g., using a state_topic).
Troubleshooting
	â€¢	Authentication Failure:
	â—¦	Ensure your CSNet Manager username and password are correct in /data/options.json.
	â—¦	Check the logs for HTTP errors (e.g., 403 Forbidden) and verify internet connectivity.
	â€¢	MQTT Connection Issues:
	â—¦	Verify that your MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto) is running and accessible.
	â—¦	Ensure the environment variables (MQTTHOST, MQTTUSER, etc.) are correctly set.
	â€¢	No Devices in Home Assistant:
	â—¦	Confirm that the add-on is publishing MQTT Discovery messages (check logs for Configuration MQTT Discovery publiÃ©e entries).
	â—¦	Restart Home Assistant after starting the add-on to trigger MQTT Discovery.
	â€¢	Logbook Issues:
	â—¦	If temperature changes are not appearing in the Logbook, verify that state_topic is correctly published and that Home Assistant is configured to log these changes.
